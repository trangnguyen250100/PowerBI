1. Data Input
- Flood-It! is a puzzle game available on both Android and iOS platforms. The app uses the standard Google Analytics gaming app implementation through Firebase. The Flood-It dataset, available through the firebase-public-project BigQuery project, contains a sample of obfuscated BigQuery event export data for 114 days. I extracted 7 days of data from that dataset.
