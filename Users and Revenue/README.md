**1. Data Input**
- Flood-It! is a puzzle game available on both Android and iOS platforms. The app uses the standard Google Analytics gaming app implementation through Firebase. The Flood-It dataset, available through the firebase-public-project BigQuery project, contains a sample of obfuscated BigQuery event export data for 114 days. For this analysis, I extracted a 7-day sample.
  
**2. Output (Dashboard)**
The dashboard provides insights into the performance of the Flood-It! game over a selected 7-day period. It consists of three main pages:

- Overview:

- Revenue:
Focuses on monetization, showcasing revenue trends, ad impressions, and in-app purchase data. It provides insights into the game's financial performance.
